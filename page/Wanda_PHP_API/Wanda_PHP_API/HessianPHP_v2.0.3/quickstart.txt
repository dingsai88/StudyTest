HessianPHP 2
Binary web services for PHP 5
http://code.google.com/p/hessianphp
----------------------------

NOTE: Documentation is still a work in progress

:: INTRODUCTION

The Hessian Protocol

   "The Hessian binary web service protocol makes web services usable without requiring a large framework, and 
   without learning yet another alphabet soup of protocols. Because it is a binary protocol, it is well-suited to
   sending binary data without any need to extend the protocol with attachments." (from Caucho web site) 

Hessian was created by Caucho Technology in the Java programming language. This protocol was designed to be fast
and simple to learn and use. It uses HTTP as transport by sending and receiving POST requests to remote services.

HessianPHP 2 is a complete rewrite of the original HessianPHP library published a few years ago to make it 
compatible with the newest versions of the protocol and PHP.

:: FEATURES

    * PHP 5 only
    * Hessian protocol version 1 and 2 with autodetection
    * Supports PHP 5.3 in strict mode
    * Can create both clients and servers
    * Support CURL and standard http stream wrappers 

:: QUICK START

Requirements and Installation

    * PHP 5.1+
    * PHP enabled web server (Apache, IIS, etc.)
    * CURL extension enabled (optional) 

Download the code and place it in a directory in your web server, that's it.

:: CONSUMING A HESSIAN WEB SERVICE

To start consuming remote Hessian web services all you need to do is:

   1. Include or require the file HessianClient?.php
   2. Create a HessianClient? object passing the url of the service and additional options if required
   3. Call methods 

This is an example code that creates a proxy to a remote service, calls several methods and prints the results:

include_once 'HessianClient.php';
$testurl = 'http://localhost/mathService.php';
$proxy = new HessianClient($testurl);
try{
    echo $proxy->div(2,5); 
} catch (Exception $ex){
   // ...handle error
}

:: CREATING A HESSIAN WEB SERVICE

You have to create a script in the web server following this steps:

   1. Include or require the file HessianService?.php.
   2. Create a HessianService? wrapper object
   3. Register a previously created or new object in the service constructur or by calling registerObject().
   4. Execute the handle() method. 

Thus, for example, if we want to publish a calculator service that is compatible with the previous example, we have
to create a class something like this:

class Math{    
  function add($n1,$n2) {        
    return $n1+$n2;    
  }    
  function sub($n1,$n2) {        
    return $n1-$n2;    
  }    
  function mul($n1,$n2) {        
    return $n1*$n2;    
  }    
  function div($n1,$n2) {        
    return $n1/$n2;    
  }
}

Then create the service wrapper and register a Math object to make it accesible through Hessian:

include_once 'HessianService.php';
$service = new HessianService(new Math());
$service->handle();

That's it. Now we have successfully published a Hessian web service from a common PHP object. The url of the 
service is the same url of the script.

If you try to access the url using a web browser, you will get a 500 error because Hessian requires POST to 
operate.

:: STATUS

Version 2.0 is in Beta phase and is the default build. It's compatible with PHP 5.3 but still in testing. 
Deployment requires a little over 100KB. Unit tests implemented using SimpleTest.

Thanks to all people that has contributed with the whole set of Hessian implementations, we hope to help you get 
the best of the project.

HessianPHP is licensed under the MIT license, so you can comfortably use it in commercial applications.

:: CONFIGURING CLIENTS AND SERVERS

Most configuration options can be set using the standard HessianOptions? class or an associative array, more on
this later. Some configuration options affect general behaviour and others are aimed only to clients or servers.

:: HOW TO USE THE CONFIGURATION

In order to configure hessian clients or servers you can create a HessianOptions object and set its properties
like this:

$options = new HessianOptions();
$options->version = 1;
$options->detectVersion = false;
$options->typeMap = array('ParamObjectJava' => 'ParamObject');

Then pass it to the constructor of either server or client:

$client = new HessianClient('http://localhost/remoteService', $options);

Using arrays

If you preffer to use arrays for configuration, you can pass an associative array where keys contain the names
of the properties, like this:

$service = new HessianService($wrappedObject, 
  array(
   'displayInfo' => true, 
   'ignoreOutput'=> true
  )
);

-------------------------------------
:: GENERAL CONFIGURATION PROPERTIES

Options that affect both client and servers.

* version	Protocol version to use, posible values are 1 and 2. The default value is 2.
* detectVersion Boollean, Defines if the library should try to detect protocl version based on incoming data. 
		Default is false.
* typeMap 	Associative array defining mappings between local and remote types (classes)
* interceptors 	Array of interceptor objects that implement the IHessianInterceptor interface that will be executed 
		in every request.
* dateAdapter 	Object. Sets an alternative object to handle date/time serialization and deserialization. The 
		objects must implement the IHessianDatetimeAdapter interface to deal with UNIX timestamps. Can be 
		used to replace the standard implementation that returns and serializes native DateTime objects 
		defined in PHP 5. Defaults to a native PHP DateTime handler.
* timeZone 	String. String defining a timezone for datetime handling, which is required in newer versions of 
		PHP. Default detected local time zone
* saveRaw 	Boolean. Tells the transport library to keep a copy of received bytes in raw form. Usefull for 
		debugging or logging.
* headers 	Array of headers to be included in each request. Not implemented yet.

-------------------------------------
:: CLIENT OPTIONS

* transport 	String/object. Defines the http communication library that clients use to send requests to remote 
		services. Available options are 'CURL' and 'http'. See description below.
* transportOptions	Mixed. Transport specific options to configure the request.

-------------------------------------
:: TRANSPORT OPTIONS

* 'CURL' (Default) uses the CURL extension to send POST requests which can be faster and better suited for 
  secure communication.
* 'http' uses standard PHP http stream wrappers (stream_context_create and fopen) to send the request. 

Optionally, you can pass an object that implements IHessianTransport using another library or method. Transport
specific options to configure the request. In the current provided implementations, the options are:

* CURL: array of options to be passed to the curl_setopt_array() function
* http: array to be merged with the options used in the stream_context_create() function. 

Please consult the PHP Manual for more information about specific options for these libraries.

-------------------------------------
:: SERVER OPTIONS

* serviceName	String. Published name of service, the default is the class name of the serviced object
* displayInfo 	Boolean. Default false. When set true, the service will display an information page with the name 
		of the service and available methods upon a browsing to the service PHP page (GET request). When 
		false, it will issue an error telling the Hessian requires POST.
* ignoreOutput 	Boolean. Default false. When set to true, the service will ignore all text produced inside method 
		calls, for example echo() and print() statements. NOTE: If any of the methods called in the service 
		writes anything to the screen, it will result in a corrupted stream.

-------------------------------------
:: ADVANCED OPTIONS

The following options exist for customizing internal behaviour of the library and it should be used carefully.

* objectFactory		Object. Replaces the default object factory with an object that implements the 
			IHessianObjectFactory interface. Can be used to get objects through IoC for example.
* parseFilters  	Associative array in which keys are the names of basic Hessian types or classes/interfaces prefixed with @ 
			and the keys are valid PHP callbacks to functions that process or transform the value just read from the service. 
			Used for transforming or filtering mostly objects into a different format or even data type. 
			Comes with a default filter 'date' to transform UNIX timestamps into native DateTime objects.
* writeFilters 		Associative array in which keys are the names of basic PHP types or classes and the values are valid PHP callbacks 
			to functions that will process or transform a value before is written into the output stream. Used to handle
			serialization of specific types, for instance, the IteratorWriter? that serializes PHP STD iterators as lists or maps. 

:: Note about multibyte character encodings (mbstring options)

PHP includes some options that change the way PHP deals with strings and string related functions, and some of these options 
can really mess up binary data if one is not careful. Concretely, mbstring.func_overload and mbstring.internal_encoding.

The former option automatically replaces some of the str_* functions with the equivalent mb_str_* functions that work 
with different character sets available in the mbstring extension. However, if you are not careful, this will also 
affect the way you would normally work with binary data including files and streams, since functions like strlen()
or substr() will work directly on characters instead of bytes, which is the normal behaviour in PHP.

The mbstring.internal_encoding option, changes the way PHP represents strings internally, including variables that 
can be used with binary services, including HessianPHP. Usually, people would set this option to UTF-8 to automatically 
handle international text. Although the library tries to detect this and work accordingly, there may be cases when a 
string sent or received with HessianPHP can not be decoded as expected. This can result in an exception with the message 
"Read past the end of stream" or simply a "Code not recognized" fault.

If you intend to use mbstring.func_overload and internal UTF-8 encoding, here are some tips 

- Save *all* your PHP source files in the UTF-8 encoding, even if there are no international characters in them.
  Better be safe than sorry.
- Make sure that your html pages are correctly encoded, including content type in the <head> section:
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" >
- If you want to work with text that comes from a remote service and local text (same source file or external file),
  make sure all of this files are also saved in UTF-8 encoding. Same goes for information that comes from a database.

As of PHP 5, converting between character encodings tends to be a somewhat frustating experience so this could help 
if you plan to change the mbstring options in your PHP installation.

:: INTERCEPTORS

With Interceptors, you can perform custom operations around the execution of remote communication, in both clients and services.

An interceptor is an object that implements the IHessianInterceptor interface and it has 2 main methods: beforeRequest and afterRequest . 
These methods accept a single HessianCallingContext? as a parameter. This object contains different information pertaining the current 
action such as the method being called, url, original configuration options and the writer and parser objects that handle the protocol
at a low level.

Check the source code for a complete description of the properties and methods in these two classes.

:: CONFIGURING INTERCEPTORS

Using interceptors is fairly simple.

   1. Create a class that derives from IHessianInterceptor
   2. Create an instance of the class
   3. Add it to the interceptors array in the configuration options passed to HessianPHP clients or servers. 

EXAMPLE

This is a simple but useful interceptor that saves the binary streams involved in the communication and also the internal log of the parser activity.

class Interceptor implements IHessianInterceptor{
        
        function beforeRequest(HessianCallingContext $ctx){
                // the call property in the context is a HessianCall object
                // representing the RPC operation. We will log only if we are a client
                if($ctx->isClient)
                        echo "Calling method: ".$ctx->call->method;

                // this tells the transport layer to save the original bytes
                $ctx->options->saveRaw = true; 
        }
        
        function afterRequest(HessianCallingContext $ctx){
                file_put_contents('outgoing.bin', $ctx->payload);
                file_put_contents('parserLog.txt', implode("\r\n", $ctx->parser->log));
                file_put_contents('writerLog.txt', implode("\r\n", $ctx->writer->log));
                file_put_contents('incoming.bin', $ctx->transport->rawData);
        }
}

// configuration
$interceptor = new Interceptor();

$options = new HessianOptions();
$options->interceptors = array($interceptor); // add interceptor 

$proxy = new HessianClient($url, $options);
// or
$server = new HessianService($testService, $options);

If you have diferent interceptors, they will execute in the order they were added to the array. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:: MAPPING TYPES

Most of the objects that are sent and received using the Hessian protocol contain a type, namely a class name attached to them. 
In strongly typed implementations, this type is used to correctly create instances of this objects, but in dynamic languages like 
PHP this is not mandatory.

However, there are cases when you need to map some remote type to a local type, for example an object that implements ActiveRecord 
that will get filled remotedly and then will be saved in a database.

To have HessianPHP create objects of the right class, you will need to create maps that will tell the library what class to create.
The typeMap property

In the configuration of both client and servers you can define mappings of concrete remote types to local types using names or wildcards.
The typeMap field in the configuration object is an associative array in which keys are the local type and values are remote types.
You can use the * wildcard in either the local or remote types for easier mapping. For example 'array' => '*.IList*' will map every 
incoming object of type IList to a PHP array

Example:

$options = new HessianOptions();
$options->typeMap['Item'] = 'com.test.model.Item'; // specific remote type mapped to local 'Item' class
$options->typeMap['Person'] = '*.Person'; // will match every class name that ends in 'Person' to the local type

NOTES

    * If you want to map remote types to local arrays, just write 'array' as the key.
    * Using the default ObjectFactory component that comes with this library, when a type cannot be resolved, 
      you will get a stdClass object with fields.
